# News-article-analysation-using-NLP-Transformer-based-models
This ongoing project aims to address the lack of accessible NLP tools for news analysis. It seeks to provide an open-source application allowing users to input news articles and receive summaries, categories, and identified entities. Utilizing methodologies like RoBERTa, BERT, T5, and GPT-2, along with techniques such as Topic Modeling and NER, the project enhances news evaluation. Although currently in the data transformation phase, it demonstrates potential to revolutionize news analysis. By democratizing insights and employing advanced NLP techniques, this initiative contributes to a more informed and connected society.
